# QuoteKeeper

QuoteKeeper has two main use cases I am desigining it for:
1)  documenting the funny things your friends say
2)  storing movie/book quotes that speak to you

I have searched for the best way to store quotes and have yet to find a good system. Currently, I am using Google Keep and adding a label to every entry. I don't love the system.
I want to have the author, the title, the page number, the date I read/saved the quoted. 

Future features:
- social media functionality: follow your friends to see their quotes. a social media platform for sharing the wisdom, wit, and intellect of others
- searchable database: searches all the book/movie quotes saved, searches all your friends' quotes from friends
- read a photo of a book page and save the text

I need to finish the user login system and fix the UI. Then, testing. Then, I will submit to the Apple App Store. My goal is to submit by summer 2020.
